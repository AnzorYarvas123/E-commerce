# E-commerce

#With WordPress, I built an e-commerce site

A site to sell electronics, and on the site you can create a special account for you and put the products you want to buy in the shopping cart, or if you want to buy later, you can put the products in the wish list, and there is also a section talking about the company and team members, and there is also a section to contact us if you want Submit a complaint or suggestions and you can change the language if you want.
